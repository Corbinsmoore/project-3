# Most Popular Names Project
Jacob Dolinsky, Joseph Devito, Corbin Moore

For our project we want to use the number of social security applicants per year dataset (https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?project=composed-setup-386914&ws=!1m5!1m4!4m3!1sbigquery-public-data!2susa_names!3susa_1910_current) -  to generate bar graphs, a choropleth map, and line graph?.  All data are from a 100% sample of records on Social Security card applications as of the end of February 2015.  To safeguard privacy, the Social Security Administration restricts names to those with at least 5 occurrences. 
The bar graphs will tell us the most popular names per year based on the numher of social security applicants.
A top ten names table/list will generate when you filter the page by year and then you could potentially filter that even further on the chorpleth map to get the most popular name in each state. THat coud be displayed when you hover over each state on the map. 
We will create the choropleth map to allow users to hover over indiv. states and see most popular names for each year.
