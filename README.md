# Most Popular Names Project
Jacob Dolinsky, Joseph Devito, Corbin Moore

For our project we want to use the number of social security applicants per year dataset (https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?project=composed-setup-386914&ws=!1m5!1m4!4m3!1sbigquery-public-data!2susa_names!3susa_1910_current) -  to generate a bar graph that displays the top ten most popular names and filters by year, a choropleth map that visully depicts the popularity of our names per state, and by year, and an interactive line graph showing the general popularity trends of our groupmembers names. 
All data are from a 100% sample of records on Social Security card applications as of the end of February 2015.  
To safeguard privacy, the Social Security Administration restricts names to those with at least 5 occurrences.
