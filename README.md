# Most Popular Names Project
Jacob Dolinsky, Joseph Devito, Corbin Moore

For our project we want to use the number of social security applicants per year dataset (https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?project=composed-setup-386914&ws=!1m5!1m4!4m3!1sbigquery-public-data!2susa_names!3susa_1910_current) -  to generate bar graphs, a choropleth map, and other tables.  All data are from a 100% sample of records on Social Security card applications as of the end of February 2015.  To safeguard privacy, the Social Security Administration restricts names to those with at least 5 occurrences. 
THe bar graphs will tell us the most popular names per year based on the numher of social security applicants.
We will create the choropleth map to allow users to filter by gender and year to see the most popular names.
